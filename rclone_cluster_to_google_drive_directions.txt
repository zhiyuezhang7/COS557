This is a short note about how to upload from your remote cluster (e.g., Genomics, Della) to google drive directly, using rclone.

rclone config

Follow instructions from https://rclone.org/remote_setup/ 

Until this question, choose Y
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine

Follow instructions from https://nooblinux.com/how-to-connect-rclone-to-google-drive-from-a-remote-server-headless/
As the link explains, run something locally that looks like 'ssh -L 53682:localhost:53682 -C -N -l zz0324 argo-comp2.princeton.edu'

After connection is completed, proceed with https://rclone.org/drive/
